## Calendar easter eggs
As this is the jubilee 10th season of Advent of Code, it heavily draws upon the previous seasons.
This can be seen in the fact that we are looking for a _historian_ and returning to places already
visited in earlier years. The calendar itself is in the shape of a huge number 10, and it contains
various elements from earlier calendars. Here are all the reused elements:
| Days  | Position | Original year | Object                                                             |
